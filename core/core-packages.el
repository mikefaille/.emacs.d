;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This library provides easy project management and navigation. The
;; concept of a project is pretty basic - just a folder containing
;; special file. Currently git, mercurial and bazaar repos are
;; considered projects by default. If you want to mark a folder
;; manually as a project just create an empty .projectile file in
;; it. See the README for more details.
